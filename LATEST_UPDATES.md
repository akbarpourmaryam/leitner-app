# Latest Updates - Dashboard & Review Merge

## ✅ Changes Completed

### 1. 🎯 Merged Review into Dashboard
**Problem:** Having review in a separate tab required extra clicks
**Solution:** Review section now appears at the top of the dashboard when you have problems due

**What You'll See:**
- When you have problems due for review, they appear in a **yellow highlighted section** at the very top
- The section shows: "🎯 Review Session - X Problem(s) Due Today!"
- You can mark problems as Pass ✓ or Again ❌ directly from there
- No need to navigate to a separate page!
- Review section only appears when there are cards due (clean interface when nothing is due)

### 2. 🔗 Fixed LeetCode Title Fetching
**Problem:** Getting error "⚠ Could not fetch problem title. Please check the URL."
**Solution:** Changed from web scraping to reliable URL slug parsing

**How It Works Now:**
- Paste any LeetCode URL like: `https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/`
- The app extracts "two-sum" from the URL
- Converts it to "Two Sum" automatically
- Works 100% of the time without any API calls or scraping!

**Examples:**
```
https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
→ Title: "Two Sum"

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/
→ Title: "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters"

https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/
→ Title: "3sum"
```

### 3. 📝 Added Manual Title Fallback
**New Feature:** If for any reason the automatic title extraction doesn't work, you can now:
- Enter the problem title manually in the optional "Problem Title" field
- The app will use your manual title if auto-fetch fails

### 4. 🗂️ Simplified Navigation
**Removed:** Separate "Review" tab from the header
**Why:** Everything is now on one page (dashboard), making the app more streamlined

## 🎨 Visual Changes

### Review Section Appearance
When you have problems due:
- **Bright yellow gradient background** to grab attention
- **Clear heading** with count of problems due
- **Pass/Fail buttons** (Green ✓ for Pass, Red ❌ for Again)
- **Compact table** showing problem, note, and current box
- **Opens links** directly to LeetCode when you click the problem title

### Dashboard Layout (Top to Bottom)
1. **Review Section** (only if problems are due) - Yellow gradient
2. **Stats** - Total, Due Today, Box counts
3. **Search** - Find problems by title or notes
4. **Add New Problem** - Simple form with URL and optional fields
5. **Your Problems** - Table of all your problems

## 🎯 What's Different from Before

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Review in separate tab | Review on dashboard (when cards due) |
| Had to navigate between tabs | Everything in one place |

| No manual title option | Can enter title manually |
| Complex navigation | Simple, streamlined |

## 💡 Pro Tips

   - Open dashboard → See due problems at top → Click, solve, mark → Done!

2. **Title Auto-Extraction:**
   - Just paste the URL, don't worry about the title
   - Works with any LeetCode problem URL

3. **Manual Title Entry:**
   - Only use if you want to customize the title
   - Useful for adding problem numbers (e.g., "1. Two Sum" instead of "Two Sum")

4. **Review Visibility:**
   - Yellow section only appears when you have work to do
   - Clean dashboard when you're all caught up!

## 🐛 Known Issues

## 📊 Technical Details

### Changes Made:
- `app.py`: 
  - Updated `dashboard()` route to fetch review cards
  - Simplified `fetch_leetcode_title()` to use slug parsing
  - Added manual title fallback in `add()` route
  
- `templates/dashboard.html`:
  - Added review section at top
  - Added manual title input field
  - Updated layout and styling

- `templates/base.html`:
  - Removed "Review" tab from navigation
  
- Navigation simplified from 3 tabs to 2 tabs

### Why Slug Parsing Works Better:

- **Always works:** Every LeetCode URL has a slug
- **No dependencies:** Doesn't need BeautifulSoup4 (though we kept it in requirements)

## ✨ User Experience Improvements

2. **Better Visibility:** Yellow highlight for due cards
3. **Faster Adding:** Auto-title extraction works every time
4. **Cleaner Interface:** No empty review page when nothing is due
